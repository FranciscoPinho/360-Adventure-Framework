1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
We've arrived at the final challenge
2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:09,000
But before we move on to that I'd like to just get a few things off my chest
3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
You know just a bit ago when I took you to that room where I first asked for your help?
4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I was actually a part of Locke's research team
5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And I had snuck that secret room in the simulation myself but it seems Locke found out about it
6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I was naive to think they would never find it
7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
All this time I tried to be secretive and pretended to cooperate
8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I wanted to keep my family safe... in case they are still even alive but I fucked it all up
9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You must be wondering why I ended up here
10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I was a top ranking researcher, only second to Dr Locke
11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I thought I was making a difference, you know...
12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Really important work
13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Doing cutting edge research for all of mankind
14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:24,000
We were tasked by the elite to develop a solution for transferring the human consciousness into the virtual world
15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
As a means of escaping the next grand extinction event on earth
16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The public is completely unaware but twenty years from now and I know it sounds like something out of a movie
17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
A giant meteor will actually fall on earth
18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The impact, subsequent natural catastrophes and atmosphere changes will annihilate us all
19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Some remote islands off the pacific were calculated to be left mostly untouched
20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I was a fool and thought they were going to try to save everyone
21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:14,000
But eventually I discovered that they had handpicked a couple thousand to be the last stand of humanity
22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
While leaving everyone else to die
23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Of the privileged chosen those who would prefer to do so would continue their biological existence
24
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Living peacefully in the small pacific islands with an artificial atmosphere isolated from the rest of the planet
25
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Procreating to keep the population in relatively stable numbers whilst maintaining the technology needed to run the simulation for those who wish to be virtually immortalized
26
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I was horrified and disgusted by these self aggrandizing parasites trying to play the hand of god
27
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Even though my family was guaranteed survival at the end of the world I still could not let it stand
28
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I was preparing to expose them but as you can surmiseâ€¦ my cover was blown
29
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Those bastards killed two birds with one stone, they forcefully used me as the very first test subject for human virtualization

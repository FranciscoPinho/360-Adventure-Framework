DOING NOW:
2. transitions 
2.1 make objects visible after certain conditions (navigation sphere after puzzle solved for exmaple)
2.2 transition into cutscene
2.3 transition into dialogue
2.4 transition into newURL/level
2.5 audio

NEW DESCRIPTION ELEMENTS
- player choice in cutscene
- 2d video cutscenes
- audio on end scene and on begin scene
- present evidence, as a choice in dialogue, have the dialogue box and the inventory below for the player to choose
- numerical input
- subtitles

USEFUL INFO

When can dialogue be presented:
OnBeginScene: have a cutscene with dialogue then transition into normal gameplay. Cutscenes of dialogue or of video. - half done
OnEndScene: transition into dialogue with flags and then transition into whatever/transition into cutscene with dialogue - half done
OnObjectExamination: onclick this object start dialogue - DONE
OnSuccessfulObjectUse - DONE
OnPickObject- DONE

When can cutscenes be played:
OnBeginScene - Start with cutscenes and transition to playable scene - done
OnEndScene - Define a new url on cutscene event emitter vs regular destination - half done
OnObjectPickup - afterPickCutscene element inside pickable component //force state to check transitions only after cutsceneplayed=false
OnObjectExamination - changeVideoSrc, instead of transitioning to a cutscene
OnSuccessfulObjectUse - changeVideoSrc, instead of transitioning to a cutscene
OnPlayerChoice - move to some other cutscene after player choice or keep going in the same, changeVideoSrc?

When can voice tracks be played: (have exclusive voice tracks, voice tracks that lower background volume, whatever else)
OnDialogue - Done
(OnObjectPickup - Done
OnObjectExamination - Done
OnSuccessfulObjectUse - Done
these are encapsulated on dialogue)
OnEndScene - to be implemented
OnBeginScene - to be implemented


OnPlayerChoice


When can Player choice appear: (different implementations for both cases)
- in Dialogue (here player choice integrated in dialogue component, add flags as necessary)
- in Cutscene  (here player choice integrated as player-choice-transition component, add flags as necessary)


Cutscenes will have 4 different mutually exclusive transition components:
cutscene-end-transition (transition into newURL/level or back to some scene after the video ends automatically, newURL takes precedence over scene destination)
player-choice-transition (pause video at player choice moment and transition to different cutscenes on player choice or resume same)
dialogue-end-transition (if it's a dialogue only cutscene, video irrelevant, transition into newURL/level or back to some scene after dialogue ends automatically)
changeVideoSrc-transition (if we only want to change the videosource cuz it's the same scenario and then change back to a neutral videosource)
Interaction components:hoverable,inventory(grabbable,use-effect),pickable,navigation-event-emitter,dialogue

if(inventoryOpen)
-disable everything else except inventory(grabbable,use-effect)
if(dialogueOpen)
-disable everything else except dialogue
else
-everything is active

Transitions:
Flag based transitions: upon certain conditions trigger a transition into something, very powerful allow for in between gameplay transitions into anything
Dialogue based transitions: after dialogue ends go somewhere possibly
Navigation based transitions: user clicks on navigation element to go to different environment
Cutscene based transitions: transition into different stuff from cutscenes, see 4 cutscene transition components
OnPickObject: Transition into voice, cutscene or dialogue that automatically transition back into playable scene
OnObjectExamination: Transition into voice ,cutscene or dialogue that automatically transition back into playable scene

On hoverable component
-can define different hover icons
-if item only flag present there is no feedback unless you try to drag an inventory object into the object

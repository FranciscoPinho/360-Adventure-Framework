TODO: Proof of concept document

DOING NOW:
1. dialogue
1.1 dialogue component needs to have:
- text itself, divided into multiple parts of x characters (maybe dialogue tree) (array?)
- newURL on end?
- newFlag but only add if no newURL, newFlag for branching dialogue
- when over, remove self
- triggerdown event handler 
- autoplay?
- zDistance from camera?
- appear near the click, in front of camera or fixed to camera 
1.2 examinable objects, just objects with new hoverable icon of magnifying glass that on click start dialogue
1.3 use object lead to dialogue
2. transitions 
2.1 make objects visible after certain conditions (navigation sphere after puzzle solved for exmaple)
2.2 transition into cutscene
2.3 transition into dialogue
2.4 transition into newURL/level

NEW DESCRIPTION ELEMENTS
- player choice in cutscene
- 2d video cutscenes
- audio
- numerical input
- subtitles
- notification

USEFUL INFO

When can dialogue be presented:
OnBeginScene: have a cutscene with dialogue then transition into normal gameplay. Cutscenes of dialogue or of video.
OnEndScene: transition into dialogue with flags and then transition into whatever/transition into cutscene with dialogue
OnObjectExamination: onclick this object start dialogue
OnSuccessfulObjectUse
OnPickObject
OnPlayerChoice

When can cutscenes be played:
OnBeginScene - Start with cutscenes and transition to playable scene
OnEndScene - Define a new url on cutscene event emitter vs regular destination
OnObjectPickup - afterPickCutscene element inside pickable component //force state to check transitions only after cutsceneplayed=false
OnObjectExamination - To be implemented
OnSuccessfulObjectUse - changeVideoSrc, instead of transitioning to a cutscene
OnPlayerChoice - move to some other cutscene

When can voice tracks be played: (have exclusive voice tracks, voice tracks that lower background volume, whatever else)
OnBeginScene - to be implemented
OnEndScene - to be implemented
OnObjectPickup - to be implemented
OnObjectExamination - to be implemented
OnSuccessfulObjectUse - to be implemented
OnPlayerChoice


When can Player choice appear: (different implementations for both cases)
- in Dialogue (here player choice integrated in dialogue component, add flags as necessary)
- in Cutscene  (here player choice integrated as player-choice-transition component, add flags as necessary)


Cutscenes will have 3 different mutually exclusive transition components:
cutscene-end-transition (transition into newURL/level or back to some scene after the video ends automatically, newURL takes precedence over scene destination)
player-choice-transition (pause video at player choice moment and transition to different cutscenes on player choice or resume same)
dialogue-end-transition (if it's a dialogue only cutscene, video irrelevant, transition into newURL/level or back to some scene after dialogue ends automatically)

Interaction components:hoverable,inventory(grabbable,use-effect),pickable,navigation-event-emitter,dialogue

if(inventoryOpen)
-disable everything else except inventory(grabbable,use-effect)
if(dialogueOpen)
-disable everything else except dialogue
else
-everything is active

Transitions:
Flag based transitions: upon certain conditions trigger a transition into something, very powerful allow for in between gameplay transitions into anything
Dialogue based transitions: after dialogue ends go somewhere possibly
Navigation based transitions: user clicks on navigation element to go to different environment
Cutscene based transitions: transition into different stuff from cutscenes, see 3 cutscene transition components
OnPickObject: Transition into voice, cutscene or dialogue that automatically transition back into playable scene
OnObjectExamination: Transition into voice ,cutscene or dialogue that automatically transition back into playable scene
